<div align="help">
  Defines additional conditions that must be met to send the notification.
  It consists from pair of template and value. If template defined
  as <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin">token macro</a>
  is equal to value then the notification is sent. It is enough that one condition
  from this section is met.
  There are many plugins that support macros so filtering by Git event or build
  parameter is now possible.
